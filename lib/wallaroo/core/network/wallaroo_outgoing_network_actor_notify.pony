    Called if name resolution succeeded for a WallarooOutgoingNetworkActor

    count is the number of connections we're trying. The notifier will be
    informed each time the count changes, until a connection is made or

    server. At this point, the connection will never be established.

    Called when multiple chunks of data are sent to the connection in a single

    before they are written. To swallow the send, return an empty
    Array[String].

    Called when new data is received on the connection. Return true if you
    want to continue receiving messages without yielding until you read
    max_size on the WallarooOutgoingNetworkActorNotify.  Return false to
    cause the WallarooOutgoingNetworkActorNotify to yield now.

    `times` parameter is the number of times this method has been called during
    this behavior. Starts at 1.

    allows a lower level protocol to handle any framing (e.g. SSL).

    respond to this by pausing additional calls to `write` and `writev` until
    you are informed that pressure has been released. Failure to respond to
    the `throttled` notification will result in outgoing data queuing in the
    connection and increasing memory usage.
